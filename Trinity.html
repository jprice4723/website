<h2>Trinity University</h2>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. The university recently celebrated it's 150th year. Trinity is a small liberal arts school, but still offers tons of opportunities 
for its students.</p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="trinity pic.jpg"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> Trinity has a beautiful campus located in the heart of San Antonio. There is no shortage of things to do on or off campus. </p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the small class sizes, access to professors, and the beautiful campus.</p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because I felt I could get more out of it compared to a bigger school. Trinity has a unique combination of a small student body and a huge amount of resources.</p>
<p>I am thinking of majoring in accounting because Trinity has a very good accounting program with a 100% job placement rate. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
